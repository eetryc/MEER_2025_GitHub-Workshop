### Install GitHub Desktop

We'll install the GitHub Desktop application first, as this should also install the most recent version of git to your computer. This app is one of the most user-friendly ways to interact with your remote repositories, and we'll be using it during the workshop. Get it [here](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Confirm git installation

Installing the desktop application should have also installed the git program, but let's double check just to be sure! Navigate to the terminal through Rstudio and type `git --version` into the command line.

Check your git version by using the terminal in RStudio

If, for some reason, git hasn't installed properly, there are several other options for doing so. See [GitHub's installation guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on their website and [this guide](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) for some helpful additional instructions.

Many (but not all!) of the options for installation are command line based, which can be intimidating if you're not used to it. If you encounter any issues installing git, please contact Sam to help figure it out!

### Create GitHub account

To use remote repositories stored on GitHub, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/). It's free and easy to do! My favorite GitHub learning resource, [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), has some tips on [how to create a good GitHub username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).

### Configure your Github credentials

GitHub uses Personal Access Tokens (or PATs) in place of passwords for security reasons. If you want to read more about why GitHub made this change, you can check out [this blog post](https://github.blog/2020-07-30-token-authentication-requirements-for-api-and-git-operations/#background). We'll be using a couple of Rstudio packages to help us configure our various git and GitHub credentials. Use the following code to install the packages:

`install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))`

Next, use `use_git_config()` to tell git where to find your GitHub account.

`usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "your name", user.email = "name@email.org")`

There is also a very simple command line approach you can [follow here](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html), if you wish.

#### Create your PAT

The instructions we provide here are for setting up PATs in R/RStudio, but you can do all of these tasks outside of R using GitHub and the command line. For additional alternatives (both in and out of R), check out the chapter on PATs in [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html?q=personal%20acces#https-pat).

Run the following line of code:

`usethis::create_github_token()`

This will open GitHub at the PAT page. Follow [the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and click "Generate Token." Copy the access token that has been generated. You will not be able to see it again once you navigate away from the page.

#### Store your PAT

To save your PAT in Rstudio, run the following using the `gitcreds` package:

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

When asked to do so, paste your PAT and hit enter. You can also check your saved PAT using `gitcreds::gitcreds_get()`

Voila! Your PAT is stored, and you're ready to use GitHub.

### Why use git?
